but not true allthe similarity discipline discipline related analysis data converting data informationin academic learning ai machine learning statistic data mining academic approach wander technical definition concept underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored case article try explain difference thus becoming primary cause confusion learner hence article explains difference explaining philosophy aim discipline rather wandering technical definitionsthen difference ai machine learning statistic data miningthen difference ai machine learning statistic data miningthe essential difference discipline lie aim approach taken achieve aimsthe aim fieldsare explained detail following sectionsartificial intelligencethe aim artificial intelligence understand intelligent entity then satisfy aim must first understand intelligence make agent intelligent agent the answer question found studying intelligent agent best example intelligent agent found standing front mirror yes human best example intelligent entity thus researcher began exploring thought process reasoning process human human being considered ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior became aim ai initial year research after setting goal study experiment began famous experiment conducted initial year achieve aim turing test turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve humanlevel performance cognitive task sufficient fool interrogator but test received criticism mimicking human behavior not exactly intelligence because intelligence related working human brain without human brain intelligence no meaning thus mimicking human thought process reasoning became transformed aim the field psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process the difference ai not try understand thought process mimic build the collaboration field resulted model neural network try mimic function neuron present human brain so basically initial aim humancentered human considered ideal intelligent agentconcurrently field computer science developing greater pace with advance computer science experiment theory could easily tested validated a program applied solve reallife problem found computer performed better human task really complex human one best example could chessplaying program an ai program defeated world best chess player garry kasparov this incident indicated human intelligence not ultimate intelligence else human would able defeat ai program this lead question human intelligence ideal intelligenceas computer became advanced proved better human certain complex task that new definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive task problem so rather considering nature agent researcher began study nature intelligence then question come test validate intelligence the best way test intelligence solve cognitive problem an agent said intelligent solve complex problem the problemsolving approach easily tested validated computer thus researcher began studying ideal intelligence selected agent validate experiment computer so computer problemsolving approach adopted so humancentered approach computer problemsolving approach two main aim ai both field contributed field giving valuable insightsboth aim important collaboratively form main aim aimachine learningin problemsolving approach big challenge ai overcome order achieve aim consider example solving math problem there two case intelligence tested problemsolving approach let u say two math problem given solve the first problem familiar second problem notconsider first problem the first problem familiar mean know solve kind problem already solved similar problem past so come question mind able solve problem the answer solved similar problem past thus learned past data solve problem thus even havent seen problem past still able solve similar problem this one form intelligenceconsider another case given second problem not solved kind problem past then solve problem try consciously gather manipulate given information reach certain conclusion this kind approach not necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process this second kind intelligencefor ai build intelligent agent kind intelligence must developed agent but reality ai reached point able build agent learn past data find useful information ai today not reached point build agent think that second type intelligenceso way ai able implement first type intelligence machine learning so domain ai focus solely implementing first kind intelligence fact machine learning that reason ml called subset ai so main difference ai mltechnically speaking it field study give computer ability learn past data find meaningful conclusion pattern without explicitly programmed this statement need elaboration the essence ml related process generalization learning past data generalization abstraction common property specific instance formulated general concept claim consider human recognize daily life object if see animal easily recognize dog cat it trivial task u ever wondered mind able the answer generalizationif given picture dog easily recognize picture dog mind abstracted description dog formulated concept dog concept became better better learned past experience dog so way think dependent fact thing represented generalized concept mindswith generalization come real information so try give computer ability generalize raw data convert information pattern trend data ownstatisticsthis discipline concern collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data statistic try deal data aim explain so study explaining data statistic two main domain descriptive statistic inferential statisticsdescriptive statistic deal explanation description data thus name descriptive statistic it try explain much information possible easily whole large data would complex task otherwiseinferential statistic try make accurate inference available small data we use inference many task daily life consider simple case cooking soup after completing recipe taste small sample spoonful soup check soup taste good bad depending upon result sample make inference whole soup soup whole good bad similarly statistic case apply inference meaningful information for example consider case not gather whole data timeconsuming costly in case applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty that inferential statistic come helpsothe use data context uncertainty decisionmaking face uncertainty statistic deal so however whatever data statistic try explain data this aim not resonate ai ml statistic help field correctly interpret datadata mining data not useful raw form consider example sensor used industrial application these sensor might used manufacturing plant sense different property like temperature pressure etc the raw data generated sensor not useful unless converted suitable form processed analyzed gather valuable insight used solve problemdue unique aim capturing essence large datasets gather insight data mining also referred knowledge discovery that carly fiorina former ceo hewlettpackard said the goal turn data information information insight this statement completely explains aim data mining so difference ai machine learning statistic data mining lie aim but approach taken field help one way fulfilling aim field this beauty
