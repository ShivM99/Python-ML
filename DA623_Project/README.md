**This repository conatin the final project for DA623, 2023-2024 batch**
  >> This project implements inear regression on synthetic 2-D data<br>
  >> It shows how MSE decreases with increasing complexity of the model<br>
  >> Finally, we visualize underfitting and overfitting<br>
I have not splitted the dataset into training & test dataset for ease
